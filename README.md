## Overview

I'm back to studying programming and I've started with the good old HTML and CSS. This is the final project of the [Origamid - HTML and CSS for Beginners](https://www.origamid.com/curso/html-e-css-para-iniciantes/) course. The layout was developed in Figma and it was the final project of [Origamid - UI for Beginners](https://www.origamid.com/curso/ui-para-iniciantes/) course.

## Origamid

Origamid is an online platform that offers courses in web development, design, and other related fields. The courses are well-structured and provide a solid foundation for beginners.

I've done other courses from Udemy and Alura, but I found Origamid's approach to be more engaging and practical. As the instructor is well versed in both design and development, the courses also cover the design aspect, which is often overlooked in other platforms.

 The courses are designed to help you build real-world projects, more similar to what you would encounter in a work environment, which is a great way to learn.

### Bikcraft Project

The Bikcraft project is a fictional e-bike brand, and the webpage is designed to showcase the skills learned in the course. The project includes various pages such as the homepage, product listings, and product details, all designed with a focus on user experience and responsive design.

## What I've Learned

- HTML structure and semantics
